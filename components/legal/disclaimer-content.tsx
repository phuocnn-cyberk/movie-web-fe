            The risk of loss involving digital assets can be substantial. You
            should therefore carefully consider whether such Services are for
            you in light of your investment objectives, financial circumstances,
            your tolerance to risks, and your investment experience. You should
            be capable of bearing a full loss of the amounts invested as a
            result of or in connection with any Services entered into with us
            and any additional loss over and above the initial amounts invested
            that may become due and owing by you. In considering whether to
            trade or invest, you should inform yourself and be aware of the
            risks generally, and in particular should note the following
            specific risk factors which may apply to any given Service.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">Service Risks:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Suitability:</strong> You should make the decision in
              relation to the Agreement and any Services with us only after due
              and careful consideration. You should determine whether a Service
              is appropriate in light of your experience in similar
              transactions, your objectives in engaging in the Service,
              financial resources, and other relevant circumstances. If you are
              not sure that the Service is suitable for you, you should obtain
              independent legal, tax, or financial advice. The greater risk
              profile and other characteristics of digital assets and private
              credit means that they are more suited to professional and other
              sophisticated investors, and investors who have experience in, and
              knowledge of, digital asset and private credit markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Money not held on deposit:</strong> Any assets transferred
              to us are not held as deposits. Any assets transferred to us in
              respect of the Account are transferred to us on a title transfer
              and proprietary basis, free from any encumbrance for the sole
              purpose of entering into Services and related activities in
              respect of the Services (including the satisfaction of certain
              fees, costs, and charges).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Money not held in segregated accounts:</strong> Unless
              otherwise agreed with you in writing, we do not hold any
              users&apos; assets in segregated accounts. Users are an unsecured
              creditor of ours, with no specific security or charge over
              particular assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Off-exchange transactions:</strong> Unless otherwise
              agreed in writing by us in respect of a specific Service, all
              transactions conducted between users and the Company are not
              carried out on exchanges, whether regulated or unregulated.
              Off-exchange transactions may involve increased risks since it may
              be difficult to liquidate existing positions, determine a fair
              price, or assess exposure to risk. They are not as transparent as
              transactions conducted on any recognized exchange.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Commissions:</strong> Before using any Service, you should
              obtain details of all commissions, fees, and other charges for
              which you will be liable. If any charges are not expressed in
              monetary terms (e.g. as a percentage of a transaction value), you
              should request the fees that will be applicable in specific
              monetary terms prior to entering any Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Suspension of trading/network events:</strong> Under
              certain conditions it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate
              a position in digital assets. Certain network events (including
              total failure of a network) may occur rapidly and affect the
              ability of holders of digital assets from conducting transactions.
              Information relating to these network events may be difficult to
              ascertain ahead of time and may be subject to limited oversight by
              any third party who is capable of intervening to stabilise the
              network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Potential for extreme volatility:</strong> Digital assets
              routinely have periods of high volatility, and occasionally have
              periods of extreme daily or even hourly volatility. Any digital
              asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to
              various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market
              manipulation, change to the nature or properties of a digital
              asset, or governmental or regulatory activity. Demand for digital
              assets may be partially or wholly driven by speculation and/or
              market sentiment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No guarantee:</strong> Investing in real-world assets
              (&quot;RWA&quot;) and digital assets involves inherent risks.
              There is no guarantee of asset performance, stability, and future
              value. RWA and digital assets are subject to various external
              factors, including market volatility, economic changes, and
              unforeseen global events, all of which may affect the value of
              your investment. You are solely responsible for performing your
              own research and due diligence before making any investment
              decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not a research report:</strong> The contents of any
              communication from the Company to you have been prepared by
              personnel of the Company. This material does not purport to be,
              and is not intended to be, a &quot;research report&quot;,
              &quot;investment research&quot;, or &quot;independent
              research&quot; as may be defined in applicable laws and
              regulations worldwide. It is intended for your general information
              about market conditions and recent events only. It is not intended
              to be provided with your particular objectives, circumstances, and
              interests in mind. Neither the Company nor the individual sender
              is soliciting any particular action or transaction based upon it
              by providing information to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Commercial arrangements:</strong> We may have
              relationships with other entities which may not be disclosed to
              you. As such, you should be aware that the Company and its
              personnel may be subject to an actual or potential conflict of
              interest. You should not rely on email or written communications
              as being either independent from the interests of the Company and
              its associated personnel, since the Company and its
              personnel&apos;s position may conflict with your own.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ownership limitations:</strong> Digital assets may
              represent ownership in an underlying asset but may not grant the
              same rights as traditional ownership. Users should understand that
              holding a digital asset does not necessarily confer direct
              ownership rights or voting powers over the underlying real-world
              assets. You should carefully review any limitations on digital
              asset functionality, rights, and redeemability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AML/KYC compliance:</strong> You may be required to
              complete Know Your Customer (&quot;KYC&quot;) and Anti-Money
              Laundering (&quot;AML&quot;) procedures to comply with regulatory
              requirements. Failure to do so may lead to account restrictions or
              asset forfeiture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Digital privacy compliance:</strong> You should be aware
              that holding digital assets may involve sharing personal
              information for regulatory compliance, which is subject to data
              privacy laws in the relevant jurisdictions and could be accessed
              by regulatory bodies if required.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No liability for loss of digital assets:</strong> We are
              not responsible for any losses, damages, or adverse outcomes
              resulting from holding, trading, or transferring digital assets,
              including losses caused by volatility, unauthorized transactions,
              or technical errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No liability for loss of RWA investments:</strong> We are
              not responsible for any losses, damages, or adverse outcomes
              resulting from holding, trading, or transferring ownership of RWA
              assets, including losses caused by volatility, unauthorized
              transactions, or technical errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Counterparty dependence:</strong> Transactions involving
              digital assets may depend on counterparties, such as exchanges,
              custodians, or other digital asset holders. If these parties fail
              to fulfil their obligations, it may impact users&apos; ability to
              transact, redeem, or transfer their digital assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of insurance coverage:</strong> Unlike traditional
              financial assets, digital assets may not be insured against loss,
              theft, or fraud. Users should be aware that losses may not be
              recoverable through traditional insurance products.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Insufficient collateralization:</strong> If the digital
              assets are collateralized by RWA, there is a risk that the
              collateral&apos;s value may fluctuate, become impaired, or be
              insufficient to back the issued digital assets, leading to
              potential financial loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Digital asset supply dilution:</strong> Digital assets may
              be subject to inflationary policies that dilute the supply and
              reduce the individual digital asset value over time. Users should
              review and understand digital asset supply mechanisms to assess
              potential impacts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>New or unproven use cases:</strong> Tokenization of RWA is
              a relatively new application, and the lack of historical
              performance data may make it difficult for users to assess
              long-term viability or financial stability.

            <li>
              <strong>Experimental nature of blockchain technology:</strong>{" "}
              Digital assets rely on blockchain technology, which is still
              evolving and may not yet be fully proven or widely adopted. The
              experimental nature of this technology means that users bear the
              risk of its potential failure or underperformance.

            <li>
              <strong>
                Loss of private key(s) is permanent and irreversible:
              </strong>{" "}
              Losing control of your private key(s) may permanently and
              irreversibly deny you access to digital assets. Neither the
              Company nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect
              digital assets to which you hold the private key(s) for. If
              private key(s) are lost, it may become impossible to transfer
              digital assets to any other address or wallet, and you are solely
              responsible for securing your private key(s) in a manner that
              meets your individual security requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Irreversibility of transactions:</strong> Blockchain
              transactions are generally irreversible, meaning any incorrect or
              unauthorized transactions cannot be cancelled or reversed, which
              could result in financial loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Source code changes and flaws:</strong> The various source
              codes underlying digital assets and smart contracts are subject to
              change and may at any time contain one or more defects,
              weaknesses, inconsistencies, errors, or bugs. Unless otherwise
              represented in writing by us, no audit or investigation has been
              conducted on any source code produced by parties other than us.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blockchain security:</strong> Transactions and records are
              stored on the blockchain, which may be subject to hacking,
              technical failures, or network disruptions. While blockchains are
              designed to be secure, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or the
              blockchain itself could lead to loss of assets or unavailability
              of tokenized services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blockchain forks:</strong> The underlying blockchain on
              which the digital assets operate may experience a fork (e.g. hard
              fork or soft fork), which could split the network and potentially
              impact digital asset functionality, value, and liquidity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Network upgrades:</strong> The Protocol updates to improve
              network performance, security, scalability, or functionality may
              require user action, such as upgrading wallets or adjusting
              settings, and could temporarily affect access to digital assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transaction transparency:</strong> Transactions conducted
              on a public blockchain are transparent, and although pseudonymous,
              users&apos; transactional history may be publicly traceable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Delayed or failed settlement:</strong> Certain digital
              asset transactions may experience delays or failures in settlement
              due to blockchain network congestion, Interface limitations, or
              third-party issues, potentially resulting in financial loss or
              missed opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cryptographic advancements:</strong> Developments in
              cryptographic technologies and techniques, including the
              advancement of artificial intelligence and/or quantum computing,
              poses security risks to all cryptography-based systems including
              digital assets. Applying these technologies and techniques to
              digital assets, the Interface, and/or the Protocol may result in
              theft, loss, disappearance, destruction, devaluation, or other
              compromises of digital assets, the Interface, the Protocol, or
              your data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reliance on the internet:</strong> Digital assets, the
              Interface, and the Protocol rely heavily on the internet. However,
              the public nature of the internet means that either parts of the
              internet or the entire internet may be unreliable or unavailable
              at any given time. Further, interruption, delay, corruption, or
              loss of data, the loss of confidentiality in the transmission of
              data, or the transmission of malware may occur when transmitting
              data via the internet. The result of the above may be that your
              order is not executed according to your instructions or not at all
              at the desired time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interface reliability:</strong> The functionality of the
              Interface and the Protocol and therefore the Services may be
              affected by unexpected technical issues, downtime, or security
              incidents, potentially impacting access to the Interface,
              Protocol, Products and the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dependence on third party service providers:</strong> The
              issuance, transfer, or management of the Interface, the Protocol,
              and the Services may rely on third party technology providers.
              Disruptions in these services could prevent you from accessing or
              managing your Products effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unauthorized access:</strong> Unauthorized third parties
              may access or use your Account and effect transactions without
              your knowledge or authorization, whether by obtaining control over
              another device or account used by you, or by other methods.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phishing and fraudulent attacks:</strong> You may be
              targeted by phishing, social engineering, or other forms of cyber
              fraud aiming to gain access to private keys or wallet information.
              Users must exercise caution and use strong security practices to
              protect their assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Malware and wallet security:</strong> If your device used
              to access your wallet is infected with malware, your digital
              assets could be at risk. You are responsible for ensuring the
              security of your devices, wallets, and any software used to manage
              digital assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platform and wallet compatibility:</strong> Digital assets
              may not be compatible with all wallets or platforms, and there is
              a risk of asset loss if a user attempts to send or receive digital
              assets on an unsupported wallet or platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interoperability challenges:</strong> In cases where users
              want to interact with multiple blockchains or platforms, lack of
              interoperability can lead to unexpected costs, delays, or asset
              inaccessibility.

          <p className="mb-4">General Risk Statements:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Market risk:</strong> There is a possibility for a user to
              experience losses due to changes in market prices of digital
              assets. It is the exposure to the uncertain market value of a
              portfolio due to price fluctuations in the digital assets
              themselves (either by reference to fiat currency, or other digital
              assets as the case may be).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> There is a possibility for you to
              experience losses due to the inability to sell or convert assets
              into a preferred alternative immediately or in instances where
              conversion is possible but at a loss. Such liquidity risk in any
              particular digital asset may be caused by an absence of buyers,
              limited buy/sell activity or underdeveloped secondary markets in
              the digital assets. Where significant liquidity risk occurs, we
              reserve the right to suspend our own trading in such digital
              assets, which may mean we are unable to provide any particular
              service in respect of digital assets on the Interface or the
              Protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inflation risk:</strong> Digital assets may, either
              because of the inherent design of the digital asset or through
              network events, not be a fixed supply of assets. Where additional
              digital assets are created, the asset&apos;s price may decline due
              to inflationary effects of adding additional digital assets to the
              total assets available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Concentration risk:</strong> At any point in time, one or
              more persons may directly or indirectly control significant
              portions of the total supply of any particular digital asset.
              Acting individually or in concert, these holders may have
              significant influence over our Interface and/or Protocol and may
              be able to influence or cause network events which may have a
              detrimental effect on price, value, or functionality of the
              digital assets. Other users may make decisions that are not in
              your best interest as a holder of digital assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Country risks:</strong> If an investment is made in any
              digital asset issued by a party subject to foreign laws or
              transactions made on markets in other jurisdictions, including
              markets formally linked to a domestic market, recovery of sums
              invested and any profits or gains may be reduced, delayed, or
              prevented by exchange control, debt moratorium, or other actions
              imposed by the government or other official bodies. Before you
              conduct use any of our Services you should satisfy yourself about
              any rules or laws relevant to those particular Services. Your
              local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the
              enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in
              other jurisdictions where your Services have been affected. You
              should obtain independent advice about the different types of
              redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other
              relevant jurisdictions before you start to use our Services. If
              your country of residence imposes restrictions on digital assets
              in any way, we may be required to discontinue your access to our
              Interface and Protocol and may not be permitted to transfer
              digital assets held in your Account back to you or permit you to
              transfer digital assets out of the Interface and the Protocol to
              yourself or others, until such time as the regulatory environment
              permits us to do so.

              <strong>
                Taxation and required reporting to taxation authorities:
              </strong>{" "}
              Unless otherwise specified, you are responsible for all taxes in
              respect of any Services used by you, including past or
              retrospective taxes which are imposed on the Services. Before
              using any Service, you should understand the tax implications of
              acquiring, entering into, holding and disposing the digital asset
              that is the subject of the Service. Tax implications of any
              Service are dependent on the nature of your business activities
              and the Service in question. You should therefore consult your
              independent tax advisor to understand the relevant tax
              considerations. We do not offer tax advice of any nature. We will
              comply with all of our obligations in terms of reporting to
              relevant taxation authorities any applicable Service which is
              required to disclose, including any details you have provided us
              about tax residency from time to time. You should seek independent
              tax and financial advice on what this may mean based on your
              individual circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tax treatment of digital assets:</strong> The tax
              treatment of digital assets varies by jurisdiction and may be
              unclear or subject to change. Users are responsible for
              understanding and complying with applicable tax obligations
              related to the acquisition, holding, and disposition of digital
              assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regulatory uncertainty:</strong> All investments,
              Services, and Products are potentially exposed to regulatory/legal
              risk. The legal and regulatory treatment of digital assets may
              change. Regulation of digital assets is unsettled and rapidly
              changing. Legal and regulatory treatment varies according to the
              jurisdiction. The effect of regulatory legal risk is that any
              digital asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due
              to legal or regulatory change. This may affect the value or
              potential profit of an investment, Product, or Service. Legal
              changes may have the effect of making a previously acceptable
              investment illegal or subject to substantial restrictions which
              may affect the ability to liquidate a position. Changes to related
              issues such as taxation may occur and radically affect the value
              or profitability of a digital asset. Such risk is unpredictable
              and depends on various geopolitical, economic, sovereign, and
              other factors. Risks may be asymmetrical between established and
              emerging markets and may affect some digital assets significantly
              more than others. We recommend that you obtain independent legal,
              tax, and financial advice and that you continue to monitor the
              legal and regulatory position in respect of your investments,
              Products and Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emerging markets:</strong> Price volatility in emerging
              markets and asset classes can be extreme (where digital assets are
              an emerging market and asset class). Price discrepancies and
              market dislocation is not uncommon. As news about digital assets
              is made available to public (which may not be before insiders have
              traded), markets may react with extreme volatility over a short
              period of time. Markets in digital assets may not have the same
              level of regulation or rules governing transparency,
              anti-manipulation measures, &quot;circuit breakers&quot; or other
              mechanisms found in more developed markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interface and digital assets reputation:</strong> News or
              negative publicity affecting the Interface, Protocol, Services,
              Products, its founders, or associated third parties can impact the
              perceived value and utility of the digital assets, affecting
              market demand and liquidity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Force majeure:</strong> We will not be liable for any
              delays, failures, or interruptions in performance resulting from
              events beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to
              acts of God, war, terrorism, civil disturbance, governmental
              actions, labour disputes, power failures, cyber-attacks,
              blockchain network congestion, and other technological failures.
              You acknowledge that such events may adversely affect access to or
              utilization of the Interface, Protocol, Services, and Products,
              and that there may be no means to recover any losses incurred as a
              result of such events.

            There are three key limbs to our AML/CTF and KYC compliance
            programme that may involve you:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Customer due diligence:</strong> We carry out customer due
              diligence to identify and verify our customers and any relevant
              connected persons. This includes screening against relevant
              commercial databases to ensure we meet our obligations. Enhanced
              due diligence may apply in certain scenarios, and the requirements
              that apply to all individuals, corporations, trusts, and
              partnerships differ. Further details about the documents and other
              information we require are available on request from us.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transaction screening and monitoring:</strong> We also
              undertake transaction screening and ongoing monitoring throughout
              the course of our relationship with the customer to ensure we meet
              AML/CTF requirements. As a result, we may ask you certain
              questions about the transactions to be entered into through the
              Interface, the Protocol, and/or the Services. We also take
              potential abuse of our Services very seriously. Abuse of our
              services could result in an immediate suspension of access to the
              Interface, the Protocol, and/or the Services and reporting to the
              relevant authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ongoing due diligence:</strong> We may ask you for
              additional information to ensure that the information and
              materials we have are up-to-date and relevant.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
            Our due diligence procedures are relevant to both preventing
            financial crime, as well as ensuring that we continue to meet our
            legal and regulatory obligations. In order to comply with regulatory
            requirements, there may also be additional products or services
            which we provide in the future that will require different
            information from you for regulatory purposes (e.g. if you qualify as
            a professional/accredited investor for certain products).

            Record keeping and reporting
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We maintain records as required by law and in accordance with our
            data protection policies and procedures. As a guide, we generally
            maintain customer due diligence and transaction records for at least
            five (5) years.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            On certain occasions, we may be required by law to submit
            information to regulators or other authorities in different
            jurisdictions. This may be required without prior notification or
            consent. For example, we may be required to submit a suspicious
            transaction report to local authorities in certain circumstances,
            including where we suspect that certain property (including digital
            assets) represent the proceeds of crime. We will generally not be
            able to inform you of such reports, as it is a criminal offence to
            do so. Without limitation, we may also be required to report certain
            tax information regarding transactions undertaken by you, either to
            local or international tax authorities, and may not be able to
            inform you of that information.
